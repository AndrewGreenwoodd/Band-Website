This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project was made using NextJS and Typescript. In this project i used loadStaticProps NextJS feature for loading
               all the website data(tour dates and music) and NextJS routing features. 
               I used redux for storing a language state, so that you can change the website
               language from Enlish to Ukrainian. I also used a custom NavLink component which simulates react-router NavLink behavior.
